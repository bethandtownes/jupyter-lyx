#8035 work around a Polyglossia bug:
# An error is reported if the document font does not announce support for a
# script (Cyrillic, Greek, ...) which Polyglossia thinks is required to
# typeset the document language. This is not required with LyX's check for
# missing glyphs and results in many false positives:
# a) with fonts including the required characters but
#    not the tag tested by Polyglossia,
# b) if the document language is "Serbian (Latin Script)",
#    the Cyrillic script is not required yet Polyglossia tests for support.
# The document "sr/Braille.lyx" is an example of case b).
# (For some reason, the false positive error is not thrown with PDF (luatex).)
